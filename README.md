### Running the game:

Clone the repository or download and expand the `.zip` archive, and move into the resulting `brainlord` directory.
	
Then, to run the game, simply **run the script `game_driver.py` with Python 3**.
	
For example:

	$ python3 game_driver.py

This will launch the GUI for the game. 
Use the buttons to navigate, and read the rules to learn how to play.

### Modules & other files:

The following files contain necessary classes and functions 
and must be in the same directory as `game_driver.py`:

- `BLapp.py`
- `board.py`
- `functions.py`
- `pegs.py`
- `row.py`

Please see the comments in each of these files for more information.
	
The following file lists the game rules, and must also be in the same directory:

- `rules.txt` 

The game stores all the player names and scores in the file:

- `scores.txt`

The first time the game is played in the given directory, this file will be created.
After that, the app will read the "scores.txt" file and display the high scores on the "High Scores" page.
Deleting this file will erase all the scores in the game's memory.
	
### Have fun, thanks for playing!
